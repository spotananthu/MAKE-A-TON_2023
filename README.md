This project is an integrated battery monitoring system designed for electric vehicles, offering real-time data collection and analysis. It aims to enhance battery safety and performance. Target audience includes electric vehicle manufacturers, retailers, and end-users.




This project named **"MODULA"** is integrated using both hardware and software system to build up a Battery Management System(BMS) for electric vehicles.

**Hardware End:**
The project addresses the need for a reliable lithium-ion battery monitoring system for electric vehicles. Current solutions often lack integration, hindering early issue detection and safety. Our hardware comprises advanced sensors, continuously monitoring battery conditions, enhancing safety, and performance.

**Software End:**
Our software complements the hardware, addressing the challenge of cohesive battery monitoring. It analyzes real-time data from the hardware, identifying deviations and converting them into user-friendly alerts and recommendations for prompt user action.

**"Modula" Website:**
We've created the "Modula" website in parallel that bridges the hardware and software components. This platform offers a secure and user-friendly interface for vehicle owners, enabling them to access alerts related to battery issues and essential services. This enhancement contributes to an overall improved user experience.
